      Hi there! My name is Natasha and I am a second year student studying Computer Programming & Analysis. So far, I have studied a diverse range of frontend and backend software technologies. This has structured my ability to learn new technologies, break down problems, and create effective solutions in large-scale projects, as revealed through my diverse portfolio. Ever since I was introduced to design and coding in high school, I have grown to love the process of making an idea come to life. Additionally, for the past 2 years I have been working as a Coding and Robotics Instructor, teaching a variety of subjects including Web Development, Robotic Automation, and Computer Vision. This environment has fueled my love for collaborative learning, where I am eager to share my passion for technology with others! When Iâ€™m not coding or tinkering with open-source hardware, I enjoy painting, reading at the library, and playing soccer with friends. Thanks for visiting my website!
